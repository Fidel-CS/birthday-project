            <h1>Hi Rizkaa🙋🏻‍♂️👋🏻</h1>
            <p>Happy special birthday! Today is the day to celebrate your extraordinary existence. I've seen how far you've come, and it's genuinely inspiring to witness the way you keep showing up and moving forward.
            <br><br>
            You've handled challenges, embraced new things, and stayed true to who you are through it all. That's not something everyone can say, and it deserves recognition.
            <br><br>
            I hope this year brings you fresh opportunities, solid progress, and plenty of moments that make you feel proud of yourself. Keep doing what you're doing—your effort, mindset, and consistency matter more than you know.
            <br><br>
            Thanks for being someone real and reliable. Wishing you a great year ahead with good energy, growth, and peace.
            <br><br>
            Happy birthday, and may each of your days be filled with extraordinary joy and achievements!</p>
